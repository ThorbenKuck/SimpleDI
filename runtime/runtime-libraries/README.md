# Runtime Libraries

This module contains a collection of standalone runtime libraries.

These libraries are used within WireDI, but they are not dependent on it, which means that they can be used without requiring the whole IOC container.

Most of these frameworks just contain simple classes, like custom collection types, time determination tools,
asynchronous code support, and the like.
