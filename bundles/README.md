# Bundles

Bundles are modules that contain preconfigured jars that can be included in your project.
They can contain auto configurations for WireDI or other frameworks.

For example, the logback-bundle bundles logback and the respected default layout.
By adding this to your project, logback will be set as the slf4j implementation, without the requirement to do anything else.
